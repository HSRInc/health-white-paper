For each area the following methodology was undertaken:
 
1. Introduction explaining the application area  
2. Use Case Scenarios
3. Data Requirements (Health and Non-Health Data)
4. Relevant OGC and Non-OGC Standards

For the data requirements the following types of data are assumed:

- *Vector*: Data that can be represented as point lines or polygons. Tabular data can be represented in vector format if there is a column that provides the geospatial coordinates.
- *Coverages*: Usually gridded data including raster and model outputs that has a grid as a reference.
- *Sensor*: Data is more dynamic in nature than vector and coverages, usually a time series of a sensor in particular location
